/***********************************************************************
 * Purpose:Write a static function toBinary that outputs the binary (base 2) 
 * representation of the decimal number typed as the input. 
 * It is based on decomposing the number into a sum of powers of 2. 
 * For example, the binary representation of 106 is 11010102, 
 * which is the same as saying that 106 = 64 + 32 + 8 + 2. 
 * Ensure necessary padding to represent 4 Byte String.
 * To compute the binary representation of n, 
 * we consider the powers of 2 less than or equal to n in decreasing order 
 * to determine which belong in the binary decomposition
 * (and therefore correspond to a 1 bit in the binary representation).
